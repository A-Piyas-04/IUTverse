🔧 Debugging Tips:

- FILE ISSUE FIXED: Added /files proxy to vite.config.js for proper PDF access

🛠️ File Access Fix Applied:
==========================
✅ Updated vite.config.js to proxy /files routes to backend
✅ Frontend server restarted to apply changes
✅ PDF files should now open correctly in new tabs

===============
1. Upload a PDF file through the interface
2. Click "📄 View PDF" button on any resource
3. Should open PDF in new tab instead of redirecting to homepage
4. URL should be: http://localhost:5174/files/filename.pdf
5. But proxied to: http://localhost:3000/files/filename.pdf
