# Course Code Feature Implementation Summary

## 📝 Overview

Successfully added a "Course Code" field to the Academic Resource Hub feature. This allows users to categorize resources by specific courses (e.g., CSE 101, EEE 201, MAT 120).

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Schema Updates

- **File**: `server/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `courseCode String?` field to `AcademicResource` model (optional field)
  - Fixed `ResourceType` enum to use `CLASS_LECTURE` instead of `CLASS LECTURE` (spaces not allowed in enums)

### Migration

- Created and applied migration: `add_course_code_to_academic_resource`
- Database successfully updated with new field

## 🔧 Backend API Changes

### Service Layer

- **File**: `src/services/academicResourceService.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getAllAcademicResources()` to support courseCode filtering
  - Added case-insensitive search capability for course codes

### Controller Layer

- **File**: `src/controllers/academicResourceController.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `createAcademicResource()` to accept courseCode from request body
  - Updated `updateAcademicResource()` to handle courseCode updates
  - Updated `getAllAcademicResources()` to support courseCode query parameter
  - Added `CLASS_LECTURE` to valid resource types

### API Endpoints

All existing endpoints now support the courseCode field:

- `POST /api/academic/resources` - Accepts courseCode in request body
- `PUT /api/academic/resources/:id` - Accepts courseCode for updates
- `GET /api/academic/resources` - Supports `?courseCode=` query parameter for filtering
- `GET /api/academic/resources/:id` - Returns courseCode in response

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### Component Updates

- **File**: `client/src/pages/AcademicResourceHub/AcademicResourceHub.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added courseCode to form state
  - Added courseCode input field in upload/edit form
  - Added courseCode filter in search section
  - Updated resource display to show course code when available
  - Added courseCode to all form reset operations
  - Updated resource types to include "Class Lecture"

### Form Features

- **Upload Form**: New optional "Course Code" field with placeholder examples
- **Filter Section**: New courseCode filter input for searching
- **Resource Display**: Shows course code as "📚 Course: CSE 101" when available

## ✅ Testing Completed

### Backend Tests

- ✅ Database operations with courseCode field
- ✅ API endpoints accept and return courseCode
- ✅ Filtering by courseCode works correctly
- ✅ Case-insensitive search functionality

### Frontend Tests

- ✅ Frontend form accepts courseCode input
- ✅ Filtering UI properly sends courseCode parameter
- ✅ Resource display shows courseCode when present
- ✅ Form validation and reset functionality

## 🚀 Features Added

1. **Optional Course Code Field**: Users can now specify course codes like "CSE 101", "EEE 201"
2. **Course Code Filtering**: Filter resources by course code with partial matching
3. **Improved Resource Organization**: Better categorization of academic materials
4. **Enhanced Search Capabilities**: Search by title, department, type, AND course code
5. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing resources continue to work (courseCode is optional)

## 📊 Impact

- **Database**: New optional field, no breaking changes
- **API**: Extended functionality, backward compatible
- **Frontend**: Enhanced user experience with better organization
- **Search**: More granular filtering capabilities

## 🎯 Usage Examples

Users can now:

- Upload a "Digital Logic Midterm 2024" with course code "CSE 121"
- Filter all "CSE" courses to see computer science materials
- Search for specific course codes like "MAT 120" for mathematics resources
- Organize resources by both department and specific course

All changes maintain full backward compatibility with existing resources that don't have course codes.
